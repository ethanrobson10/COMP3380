# COMP 3380 Project - NHL Database

## Running Program
1. Navigate to the interface directory:
  ```bash
    cd interface
  ``` 

2. Run the program:
  ```bash
    make run
  ``` 

## Populating Database
- The database has already been populated by executing the 36 SQL file 'chunks' in the sql_chunks directory
  (we separated the inserts for better efficiency).
- Repopulating the database is possible through the main interface by using the 'REPOP' command.

## Additional Info
- Our project connects to Drea's uranium account. The userid and password are stored in the data directory in the auth.cfg file.
